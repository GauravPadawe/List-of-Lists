# List-of-Lists - Quiz from Udacity #

Define a procedure, total_enrollment, that takes as an input a list of elements, where each element is a list containing three elements: 
1) a university name,
2) the total number of students enrolled,
3) the annual tuition fees.

The procedure should return two numbers, not a string, giving the total number of students enrolled at all of the universities in the list, and the total tuition fees (which is the sum of the number of students enrolled times the tuition fees for each university).

usa_univs = [['California Institute of Technology',2175,37704],
              ['Harvard',19627,39849],
              ['Massachusetts Institute of Technology',10566,40732],
              ['Princeton',7802,37000],
              ['Rice',5879,35551],
              ['Stanford',19535,40569],
              ['Yale',11701,40500]]
              
Note: The L in the output is automatically added by Python to indicate a long number. If you are trying the question in an outside interpreter you might not see it.
